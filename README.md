# Software_Engineer_Salary_Prediction

   I have created a Web app with Streamlit for predicting Software Engineer Salaries by taking the data for 2023. I have trained a machine learning model using the Decision Tree model with an error of $abs(29000).
   The user has to select the country, experience, and Education Level and then press the ok button. The result will appear at the bottom

Result:

Education = Bachelors,
Years of Experience = 4 years
